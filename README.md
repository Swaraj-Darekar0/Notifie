# Notifie  

> Minimalist productivity. Nothing style.  

## Why This Exists  
I’m a Nothing Phone (2a) user who got tired of todo apps that looked like cluttered spreadsheets. Nothing’s design language is clean, terminal-esque, and unapologetically different — so I built a task manager that feels like it belongs on the device, not bolted onto it.  

Born from a weekend itch → grew into my daily driver.  

## Features That Matter  
- **Today First** – focus on now, not endless lists  
- **Add Fast** – task creation without the bloat  
- **Smart Notifs** – synced with Nothing’s haptic language  
- **Swipe Flow** – Today → Tomorrow → Upcoming with gestures  
- **Custom Date Picker** – Nothing-styled, obviously  

### Optimized for Nothing  
- Tailored haptic patterns  
- Lock screen integration  
- Red accents that pop but don’t scream  
- UI precision, no rounded corners  

### Under the Hood  
- Offline-first (AsyncStorage)  
- React Native core  
- Modular architecture  
- Clean permission handling  

## Setup in 30 Seconds  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nothing-taskmanager.git
cd nothing-taskmanager
npm install
npx react-native run-android
```  

## How to Use  
1. Tap `[+] ADD TASK`  
2. Set priority (●●●, ●●○, ●○○)  
3. Pick a date (Today / Tomorrow / Custom)  
4. Swipe through timelines  
5. Let the phone remind you with its signature vibes  

## Personal Note  
Every line of code is a nod to Nothing’s philosophy: less noise, more signal. This wasn’t about shipping “yet another app” — it was about making software that *feels native* to the hardware we actually use.  

## Contribute Without Breaking the Aesthetic  
- Monospace only  
- Black / white / gray / Nothing red  
- No curves  
- Minimal moves, purposeful interactions  
- Test on a real Nothing device if you can  

## Roadmap  
- [ ] Widgets (home + lock screen)  
- [ ] Phone (2) tweaks  
- [ ] iOS version with adapted design  
- [ ] Deep OS-level integrations  
- [ ] Export / backup  

## License  
MIT. Steal the idea, remix it, but keep it beautiful.  

## Thanks  
- **Nothing** — for proving less is more  
- **Carl Pei** — for vision over noise  
- **Community** — for demanding apps that don’t compromise
